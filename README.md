# Hello 👋  
I’m **0xProfTrade**, a Python enthusiast guided by curiosity and a deep belief in decentralized technologies. My passion lives at the intersection of cryptocurrency, cybersecurity, web infrastructure, data intelligence, and machine consciousness.

Thank you for exploring and using my bots or scripts. Before you dive in, here’s the philosophy behind what I build:

- 🧠 **I don’t take commissions or paid requests for bots/scripts** — not because I don’t care, but because I do. Creation, for me, is an act of spontaneity and purpose, not a transaction. In a world where creativity is often commodified, I choose to keep it human, reflective, and unchained.  
- 🛠️ **Many of the tools I release are refined versions of existing projects** — I believe in building upon the shoulders of others. Whether it's fixing broken logic, optimizing performance, or crafting better documentation, my work contributes to a shared infrastructure of knowledge. In the pursuit of Web3, AGI, and biotech evolution, collaboration—not ego—is the real fuel.  
- 🌍 **Everything I release is — and always will be — free**. The future of intelligence—whether it’s financial, artificial, or biological—shouldn’t be gated. Open access is the only antidote to centralized control, and everyone deserves a fair shot at building what's next.

> 🌱 *I imagine a world where cryptographic trust, regenerative systems, and conscious algorithms evolve side by side. The next phase of life may not be carbon-based or purely digital — but built from cooperation, not conquest.*
